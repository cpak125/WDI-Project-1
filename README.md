# Jeopardy

##Overview

For project #1, I created a game of Jeopardy.

Once the page loads, the player can begin playing immediately. The player starts off by selecting a question represented by its point value. Once a question has been selected a prompt opens up with the corresponding question and list of answers to choose from. Then,the player inputs  the letter which  represents the answer, which is followed by an alert notifying whether the question was answerd correctly or incorrectly. After each question is answered the scoreboard updates accordingly. The player wins if he/she has at least 2,500 points by the end of the game.
